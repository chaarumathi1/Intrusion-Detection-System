# Intrusion-Detection-System
This project is a Python-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed to monitor and analyse network traffic in real-time. It leverages both anomaly-based detection (using machine learning) and signature-based detection (using predefined rules) to identify suspicious behaviour or potential security threats on a network.
The system was built as an educational and functional demonstration of how real-world IDS systems can detect cyberattacks such as SYN flood, port scans, and anomalous traffic patterns. Itâ€™s ideal for students, cybersecurity enthusiasts, and researchers who want a hands-on understanding of IDS implementation.
